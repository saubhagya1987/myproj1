<H2 CLASS="western">Known Issues and Workarounds</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.10in"><U><B>Data Migration:</B></U></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.10in">The following Items have not been
migrated:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.10in">1. Product recommendation changes at
partner level are not migrated and each partner will have to visit
Setup again and reconfigure his recommendation. This is because
recommendation is very different between the old and new version. We
have now introduced risk and goal duration.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.10in">2. DC Input and Goals are not
getting migrated again because of very different ways in which these
are stored in the two versions. Tejas and team will have to punch all
the DC Inputs again and we will disable email/sms notification for
that period.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.10in">3. PSTs mapped to partners in BUs -
FFreedom, SPA and DFDA have not been migrated. This is because we
have enhanced the mapped service team functionality in this release
and allowed one PST to be mapped in multiple Biz Units requiring only
1 login. In current live version 2.5, we had created multiple login
accounts for same PST for each mapped Biz Unit.  The responsible
person within PST team should manually add the PSTs for the above 3
Biz Units using Service Team Allocation screen.</P>
