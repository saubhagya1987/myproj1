          <div class="bx_two_one clearfix"><div class="circle">1</div> <span>Articulation of Financial Goals:</span> The first step in financial planning process is to articulate your financial goals and responsibilities. If goals are your destination the financial plan is the road map which will help you to reach your goals smoothly & in a definite time horizon. </div>
          
          <div class="bx_two clearfix"><div class="circle">2</div> <span>Contingency Planning:</span> Financial planning begins with bracing yourself for unforeseen events or emergencies and reducing the impact of adverse conditions in your life. A contingency fund is a backup plan in case of a job loss/income loss or any other emergency. Everyone needs to plan for some emergencies like health related expenses and Social Responsibilities.</div>
          
          <div class="bx_two clearfix"><div class="circle">3</div> <span>Risk Planning:</span> Risk Planning includes three areas: Life, Health and Asset. At Ffreedom, We follow a scientific approach of calculating the Human Life Value to determine the correct Insurance needs for our clients. Health Insurance is one of the most critical ways to cover the Health related risks which if not planned, might have a huge financial impact. Similarly, Assets should also be insured against any natural disasters or other such events. </div>
          
          <div class="bx_two clearfix"><div class="circle">4</div> <span>Retirement Goals:</span> Retirement has the highest weightage in your financial goals, as this is the period where you would get time to do things apart from your professional life. At Ffreedom, we strongly believe that "Retirement means not to stop working but to stop working for money". Hence, you should have a retirement corpus in place ,not only a corpus but a plan on how you would like to spend the days in your retirement. </div>
          
          <div class="bx_two clearfix"><div class="circle">5</div> <span>Estate Planning :</span> Irrespective of the any stage of your life it is always a good idea to plan for your dependents since life sometimes takes unfortunate unexpected turns, it is advisable to keep your bank accounts in joint names & if not, do have a POA which can take care of any emergencies. Do not leave things to chance, prepare a Will well in advance to protect your family. </div>
