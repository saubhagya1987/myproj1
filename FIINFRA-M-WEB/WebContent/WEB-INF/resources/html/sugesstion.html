            <p>Your loan commitments seem within normal limits. However getting out of loans sooner can release cashflows that can be used for other beneficial purposes.</p> 
            <p class="strong">You can :</p> 
             <ul>
<li>Consider consolidating your loans by taking a larger lower cost loan and repay the higher cost loans</li>
            <li>Extend the tenure of loan for a short while, to handle cashflows better</li>
             <li>Negotiate good deals and repay some loans if possible</li>
             <li>Follow debt repayment plans like debt snowballing etc to get out of debt. Subscribe to our debt management services for customised help.</li>
